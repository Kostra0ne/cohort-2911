# Create a Rick and Morty App !

Your app should have:

- A `Navbar` component with `Navlink`(s)
- A `Routes` component wrapping some `Route`
- A `Route` with a path of `"/"` rendering a `List` component
- A `Route` with a path of `"/:id"` rendering a `OneCharacter` component

- `List` should have a state and get it's data from `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/`
- `OneCharacter` should have a state and get it's data from `https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/:id`

- Add some styling !
